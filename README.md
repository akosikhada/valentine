> _"Love is not just looking at each other, it's looking in the same direction."_ — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

## ✨ Features & Enhancements

## 💕 How It Works

The website presents a Valentine's proposal with two options: "Yes" and "No". As you might guess, selecting "No" isn't really an option! Each time "No" is clicked, the button gets smaller while the "Yes" button grows larger. Meanwhile, romantic messages change to express increasingly heartfelt pleas.

When "Yes" is finally selected, a celebration animation begins with floating hearts and a sweet confirmation message.
